Hi my name is Jennifer Fomenko, I'm a junior computer science student and the vice president of moon club! 

While i'm new to data science I spent the summer doing the Stanford x Deep Learning AI machine learning specialization.

In data science a mistake often made through removing data from it's context and assuming there is some universal truth to data devoid of context. We believe that doing this can remove sources of bias and misunderstanding, however, this mistake often causes more bias albeit unintentionally.
